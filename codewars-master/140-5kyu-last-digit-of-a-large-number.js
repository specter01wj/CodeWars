/*
Define a function

var lastDigit = function(str1, str2){
  // see JavaScript remarks below
}

that takes in two numbers a and b and returns the last decimal digit of a^b. Note that a and b may be very large!

For example, the last decimal digit of 9^7 is 9, since 9^7 = 4782969. The last decimal digit of (2^200)^(2^300), which has over 10^92 decimal digits, is 6.

The inputs to your function will always be non-negative integers.

Examples

lastDigit("4", "1")           //       4 => 4
lastDigit("4", "2")           //      16 => 6
lastDigit("9", "7")           // 4782969 => 9    
lastDigit("10","10000000000") //=> 0

Remarks
JavaScript

Since JavaScript doesn't have native arbitrary large integers, your arguments are going to be strings representing non-negative integers, e.g.

lastDigit("10", "10000000000");

The kata is still as hard as the variants for Haskell or Python, don't worry.
