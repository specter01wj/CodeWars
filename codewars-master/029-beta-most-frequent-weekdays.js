/*
What is your favourite day of the week? Check if it's the most frequent day of the week in the year.

You are given a year as integer (e. g. 2001). You should return the most frequent day(s) of the week in that year. The result has to be a list of days sorted by the order of days in week (e. g. ['Monday', 'Tuesday']). Week starts with Monday.

Input: Year as an int.

Output: The list of most frequent days sorted by the order of days in week (from Monday to Sunday).

Preconditions: Year is between 1 and 9999. Week starts with Monday.

Example:

most_frequent_days(2427) == ['Friday']
most_frequent_days(2185) == ['Saturday']
most_frequent_days(2860) == ['Thursday', 'Friday']
*/

function mostFrequentDays (year) {
  var days = ['Sunday','Monday','Tuesday','Wednesday','Thursday','Friday','Saturday','Sunday'];
  var firstDay = new Date("January 01, " + year);
  var answer = [];
  answer.push(days[firstDay.getDay()]);  
  if ((year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) | year % 400 === 0) {
    answer.push(days[firstDay.getDay()+1]);
    if (answer[0] == 'Sunday') answer = ['Monday','Sunday'];
  }
  return answer;
